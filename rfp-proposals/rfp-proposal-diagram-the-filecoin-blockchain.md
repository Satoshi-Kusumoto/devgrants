# Project Description
Diagrams of the Filecoin blockchain at the level of detail and visual quality of Lee Thomas’ [diagram of the Ethereum Yellow paper](https://i.stack.imgur.com/afWDt.jpg) and [state trie](https://i.stack.imgur.com/s6yKz.png) [[Source](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/268/ethereum-block-architecture)].

## Value to the Filecoin ecosystem
When John trains blockchain developers (especially after they have gained the ability to write smart contract or to write backend code like RPC client), Ethereum's architecture is a must to dive into detail. While the yellow paper and Geth are the best first hand materials, Lee Thomas’ [diagram of the Ethereum Yellow paper](https://i.stack.imgur.com/afWDt.jpg) helps greatly not only to the trainees, but the trainer as well. Besides, these kind of diagrams are easy to spread on the Internet, therefore could reacher more potential developers.

Filecoin's spec, almost could be called a nature language implementation of Filecoin, is the best spec John has ever seen. And could be used as a textbook. However, it is extremely long (more than 400 pages to print), frightening new comers and making them hard to have an overall idea. Therefore, the spec awaits high quality diagrams.

## Contents to be covered by the diagram
Though a read of the spec, John have identified at least three parts to cover: whole life cycle, storage and retrieval cycle and state trie. Further contents to cover will be identified at the first stage of the project. 

## Deliverables
- Diagrams of Filecoin Blockchain including the whole life cycle, storage and retrieval cycle, state trie and other necessary parts at the level of detail and visual quality of Lee Thomas’ [diagram of the Ethereum Yellow paper](https://i.stack.imgur.com/afWDt.jpg) and [state trie](https://i.stack.imgur.com/s6yKz.png) [[Source](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/268/ethereum-block-architecture)]
- Two articles and a talk introducing Filecoin and its architecture in the Community

## Development Roadmap

### Milestone 1: Diagrams to cover identified
Specifics:
- Identifying necessary parts of the system to cover as diagrams
- Summaries and notes of rough flow of the parts to cover

During this period, John will do an overall study of Filecoin spec and implementations.

People Involved:
John

### Milestone 2: Literal materials for drawing diagrams ready
Specifics:
- Finalized scope and design of each diagrams
- Detailed summaries and notes that can be directly converted into diagrams
- An article about the overall architecture of Filecoin
During this period, John will go deeper into Filecoin spec and implementations.

People Involved:
John

### Milestone 3: Diagrams delivery
Specifics:
- Diagrams delivery
- An article summarizing the journey of the project
- An online talk in Chinese community explaining Filecoin blockchain using the delivered diagrams 
Plotting and refining time.

People Involved:
John

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

John will maintain the diagrams long-term and upgrade them upon Filecoin's breaking changes.

## Relevant Experience

Dr. John has 3 years of smart contract and blockchain R&D experience and has a good understanding of overall blockchain architecture. He is former blockchain tech lead at LOTS, and lead blockchain engineer at ARPA. Currently as CTO of Cdot network he focuses on cross-chain protocols and Substrate. He keeps giving lectures about smart contract, blockchain basics and Ethereum yellow paper to new employees. He was among the lecturers of the first blockchain course in Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan.

As a blockchain engineer and product manager, he has won several hackthons related to cross-chain and Substrate in the last year.

He is also very active in the community. He is a Polkadot technical ambassador, having written many articles and tutorials about Polkadot and Substrate and has given a talk at Web3 Summit in 2019. He is also one of the editors of Rust.cc (Chinese largest Rust community). He has been organizing talks and workshops about Substrate and Rust in the community. He is teaching assistant at blockchain developer oriented courses including Ethereum, Substrate and Blockstack.
